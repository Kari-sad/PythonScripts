Flow of working
===============

=>Created the main base admin/management files for the application
django-admin startproject profiles_project .

=>Created the application using manage.py
python manage.py startapp profiles_api

=> Added teh application to enable their functionality in django server by adding them to setting.py 'INSTALLED_APPS' variable.

=> testing the new configuration by starting the django server.
python manage.py runserver ### runs the server but accepts connections only from localhost enviornment.
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 ## Runs the server but accepts connections from all over.

=> At this point only the page is available but the DB is not ready, to enable DB auth functionality create a model.
=> To override the default functionality of Djangeo Users modes create a new modes 'UserProfile'
=> to make use of and map the UserProfile model created a UserProfileManager model which inherits from BaseUserManager

    ## Custome userprofile manager to override the default
    objects = UserProfileManager() # to call
    # Overriding the default username field to email
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email' # overriding the primary Key and login
    ## required field
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [ 'username', 'first_name' , 'last_name' ] # Other Mandatory fields

=> To enable the created model and tell Django to use it for authentication, it has to be written in setengs.py 
   # Overriding the default model at variable  AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'appname.authenticationClass'

=> Dango created tables and manages authentications through migrations, So initially or if any change is made to the database tables
    # it is required to make migrations tii create or update the existing
    python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>

    Output:
    Migrations for '<app-name>':
    <app-name>/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model <the class which is given in settings.py>
=> To setup the created migration on to a DB

=> to make the model available to users, add it in admin.py
from profiles_api import models
# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(models.UserProfile)
